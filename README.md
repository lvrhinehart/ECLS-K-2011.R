# Analysis using ECLS-K:2011

# This is the code I wrote for my dissertation analysis. My dissertation was comprised of three studies that used the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011 (ECLS-K: 2011). 

# Study 1 identified variables measured in kindergarten that predict learning disability (LD) identification by 4th grade. Next, Study 2 explored how students receiving special education services for ADHD differed from general education students. Finally, Study 3 examined students with low reading and math achievement, with and without special education placement, and describes how they differ on a number of factors. Each study used binary logistic regression to assess which Kindergarten academic, executive functioning, sociodemographic, and behavioral variables significantly predicted the odds of being in the group of interest in 4th grade. Two of the studies also utilized a latent profile analysis (LPA) to create smaller, homogeneous subgroups within a larger heterogeneous group.
